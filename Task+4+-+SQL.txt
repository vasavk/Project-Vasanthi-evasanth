1) Create a table named "sales_sample" with the specified columns: Product_Id (Integer), Region (Varchar(50))- like east, west etc, Date (date), Sales_Amount (Int/numeric) using PostgreSQL

CREATE TABLE sales_sample (
  Product_Id INTEGER,
  Region VARCHAR(50),
  Date DATE,
  Sales_Amount NUMERIC
);

2) Insert 10 sample records into the  "sales_sample" table, representing sales data

INSERT INTO sales_sample (Product_Id, Region, Date, Sales_Amount)
VALUES
  (1, 'UK', '2023-01-01', 1000),
  (2, 'DE', '2023-01-02', 1500),
  (3, 'FR', '2023-01-03', 800),
  (4, 'IT', '2023-01-04', 1200),
  (5, 'ES', '2023-01-05', 2000),
  (1, 'CA', '2023-01-06', 750),
  (2, 'MX', '2023-01-07', 1100),
  (3, 'AU', '2023-01-08', 900),
  (4, 'JP', '2023-01-09', 1800),
  (5, 'IN', '2023-01-10', 1250);

3) Write a query to perform drill down from region to product level to understand the sales performance

SELECT Region, Product_Id, SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY Region, Product_Id
ORDER BY Region, Product_Id;

4) Write a query to perform roll up from product to regionlevel to view total sales by region

SELECT Region, SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region;


5) Cube - To analyze sales data from multiple dimensions simultaneously. Write a query to Explore sales data from different perspectives such as product, region and date

SELECT Product_Id, Region, Date, SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY CUBE (Product_Id, Region, Date)
ORDER BY Product_Id, Region, Date;


6) Slice - To extract a subset of data based on specific criteria. Write a query to slice the data to view sales for a particular region or date range

SELECT Product_Id, Date, Sales_Amount
FROM sales_sample
WHERE Region = 'UK'
ORDER BY Product_Id, Date;

7) Dice - To extract data based on multiple criteria. Write a query to view sales for specific combinations of product, region and date

SELECT Product_Id, Region, Date, Sales_Amount
FROM sales_sample
WHERE Product_Id = '4' AND Region = 'IT' AND Date = '2023-01-04'
ORDER BY Product_Id, Region, Date;
